In this video, I'll identify the types of Agile management tools and provide some examples of each tool type.

[Video description begins] A web page titled Atlassian is open in a browser window. The menu bar has the following options: Products, For teams, and Support. Below it, a menu bar is present for Jira Software. It has the following options: Features, Product guide, Enterprise, and Pricing. In the center pane, there is a button titled Try it free.

The key to success in Agile development is to enable flexibility while maintaining organization. And the best way to do this is to deploy a set of good tools that help track the project and organize the team's progress. We also want to make sure that they don't impose strict schedules and roles but make it easier for developers to self-manage and converge on their goals. So a common feature on all of these Agile tools is a graphic dashboard that reports on how the team is progressing and meeting their goals.

And there are some more sophisticated tools that work with integrated code repositories and CI, continuous integration, tools. So good Agile tools organize discussion and planning and enable efficient communication. So one such tool that we could look at is Jira. And Jira describes itself as the number one software development tool used by Agile teams. Jira is packed with features. It's highly configurable, and it's usable in all sorts of situations. But it takes time to set up if you want to get the best out of it. Jira has more than 3000 apps that can help you expand its functionality. Many of those apps charge per user but the prices don't seem too steep.

Time can be tracked as well. And it has a useful backup manager that enables you to backup your projects to the cloud. And you can also generate reports to help assess your team's performance and you can do that in a few clicks. There's over 20 options for those charts there, the usual pie and bar charts. There's resolution time reports, sprint reports. One drawback though is that the user interface isn't always intuitive. It can be sometimes time consuming to get up and running easily. And it might take you a developer to configure it the way you want. So that's Jira.

[Video description begins] A web page titled PivotalTracker appears. At the top, the following buttons are present: Log in, Sign up, and Menu. [Video description ends]

Pivotal Tracker, so Pivotal Tracker is another one of the top applications for managing development teams. Pivotal Tracker is made and set up to keep your Agile team on track with their sprint goals. And it makes it easier for teams to adapt and evolve to changes that might pop up mid sprint. They also strive to make the goals clearer and they help do that by increasing transparency among the teams. And at a glance, you can quickly see what all the members of the team are working on, who is responsible for what, and how far you are from meeting the goals for the sprint. And this helps promote accountability across the team.

[Video description begins] Another web page titled Planview LeanKit appears. The following options are present at the top: Product, Solutions, Pricing, etc. Beside it, there are two buttons: Sign Up Free and Login. The page contains a button titled: Start Your Free Trial. [Video description ends]

Then we have LeanKit. So LeanKit's different to Jira and Pivotal in that it aims to imitate the conference room whiteboards where most projects might begin. So it lets all the team members post virtual notes or cards that represent all the tasks. The user stories are bugs that need to be addressed. And as the team finishes them, the board then updates faster than a whiteboard would in, in an office for example.

The software also allows multiple teams to work together in separate spaces while still coordinating their interactions. And it's perfect for distributed teams to help ensure that everyone can see the Kanban board in real time. LeanKit also works great for cross platform teams. And it can be used to keep track of the dependencies between those teams. LeanKit also works well for cross functional teams by leveraging a Scrum or Kanban boards.

[Video description begins] A web page titled Axosoft appears. The menu bar has the following options: Scrum & Bug Tracking, Help Desk & Wiki, Pricing, and Your Success. In the center pane, the following text is displayed: Axosoft is the Scrum software for agile teams. Two buttons are present below it: Start Free Trial and Watch Product Tour. [Video description ends]

And then finally, we have Axosoft. So Axosoft is basically, as it says here, the Scrum software for Agile teams. It's specifically a Scrum management software. So it allows you to manage everything from planning through to release, Axosoft helps you visualize every step of the development process. Have some really impressive looking graphs if that's something that's important to you. It lets you plan features in order of importance so that the most important features are going to get completed first. It also has tools for helping plan out when certain features will be done. Their reporting tools are pretty good. The graphing is very well done. But it's not as full featured as some other products.
