Topic Title: Agile Development Process

In this video, I'll describe the steps involved in basic Agile project management process. 

So let's examine the Agile development process. 
Agile development encourages an ongoing process of improvement. 
The goal of Agile is to produce : 

shorter development cycles, resulting in more frequent product releases than a traditional waterfall process. 
It's possible to use any number of different Agile project management frameworks, but each one follows the same basic process. 

So first, there's 

1. project planning, 
   2.sprint planning, 
     3. product roadmap creation, 
       4. daily meetings, 
         5.release planning, and 
           6. review and retrospectives.

Project Planning.

So the Agile method of project management and software development is designed to be ready for change 
and to manage additions to the project easily. 
Before beginning a project, the team should 

*** understand the end goals, 

understand the 

****value to the organization of the client and how it will be achieved. 

And in this stage, you can also 

*** develop a project scope. 

But it's important to remember that the project scope shouldn't be seen as unchangeable.

 
**** A product roadmap 

is a plan of action for how a product or a solution will evolve over time.

A product roadmap includes a 
*** breakdown of the features that will make up the final product. 

**** project deliverables ***

When it's used in Agile development, a roadmap provides crucial context for the team's deliverables. 

Because the team will deliver these individual features using each sprint. 


So in this stage, you'll also develop a 

*** product backlog*** , which is a list of all the features 
and deliverables that will make up the final product. 
And this helps link the team's 

*** project tasks*** back to the product roadmap.


* Release planing

Instead of trying to develop every proposed feature in one large, 
regimented project, 
Agile planning breaks down the development process into stages called releases. 

In traditional waterfall project management, there's one implementation date and that comes after an entire project has been developed. 

When using an Agile methodology, the project ***uses shorter development cycles called sprints. ***
There are then ***periodic releases*** of features at the end of each sprint cycle. 

****Feature release plan

Release planning also creates a high level plan for these future releases.

 

Sprint Planning.

Before each sprint begins, the stakeholders will need to hold *** planning sessions. 
So they can plan what will be accomplished by each person during that sprint and how it will be achieved. 

*** Team transparency 

They'll need to confirm team capacity, as well as any currently known issues and concerns, 
and record those as appropriate in a transparent way. 

*** Task asignment

It's important to note that it's the team that selects how much work they can do in coming up 
with the sprint and who to assign it to. 

*** Remove bottlenecks

And it's also important to share the load evenly among team members so that they can 
accomplish their assigned tasks during the sprint and help avoid or remove bottlenecks.

*** Daily meetings

Each day, at about the same time, the team needs to hold a meeting so as to bring everybody up to date. 
Each member will walk through and talk about what they accomplished the day before and 
what they'll be working on that day. 
Usually, scrum's three questions are used to structure that meeting's discussion. 

**** One, what have you completed since the last meeting, 
which is usually yesterday? 

****Two, what are you planning to complete by the next meeting or today? 

****Three, what are your roadblocks, what's getting in your way? 

These daily meetings should only be 15 minutes long.

At the end of each sprint, your team is going to hold two meetings. 

First, 

*** Sprint Review

you're going to hold a sprint review with the project stakeholders. 
This is where the project team demonstrates the results of the work that they have done in the sprint, 
and the required stakeholders accept that work or don't. 
It's an important part of keeping **open communication** with the stakeholders, 
and it's also an important time to **receive feedback** from the stakeholders.

receive feedback

Second

Sprint retrospective

you're going to have a sprint retrospective meeting with your stakeholders.

And the purpose of this meeting is to reflect on **what went well and what didn't go well** in the previous sprint, 
to determine how things can be improved in the next sprint. 
And then if your team's new to Agile project management, we don't want to skip this meeting. 

Because it's going to help us gauge the team load or how much the team can tackle during 
each sprint and determine the most effective sprint length for future projects. 
In simple terms, the sprint review is focused on product and maximizing the business value of 
the results of the work of the sprint you've just completed. 
And then the sprint retrospective is focused on the process and continuous process improvement.
